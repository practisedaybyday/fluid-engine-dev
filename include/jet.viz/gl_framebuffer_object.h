//!
//! \brief OpenGL framebuffer object.
//!
//! This class encapsulates the GLFramebufferObject (FBO) OpenGL spec. See the
//! official spec at:
//! http://oss.sgi.com/projects/ogl-sample/registry/EXT/framebuffer_object.txt
//! for details.
//!
//! A framebuffer object (FBO) is conceptually a structure containing pointers
//! to GPU memory. The memory pointed to is either an OpenGL texture or an
//! OpenGL RenderBuffer. FBOs can be used to render to one or more textures,
//! share depth buffers between multiple sets of color buffers/textures and are
//! a complete replacement for pbuffers.
//!
//! Performance Notes:
//! 1) It is more efficient (but not required) to call bind()
//! on an FBO before making multiple method calls. For example:
//!
//! \code{.cpp}
//! GLFramebufferObject fbo;
//! fbo.bind();
//! fbo.attachTexture(GL_TEXTURE_2D, texId0, GL_COLOR_ATTACHMENT0_EXT);
//! fbo.attachTexture(GL_TEXTURE_2D, texId1, GL_COLOR_ATTACHMENT1_EXT);
//! fbo.isValid();
//! \endcode
//!
//! To provide a complete encapsulation, the following usage
//! pattern works correctly but is less efficient:
//!
//! \code{.cpp}
//! GLFramebufferObject fbo;
//! // NOTE : No bind() call
//! fbo.attachTexture(GL_TEXTURE_2D, texId0, GL_COLOR_ATTACHMENT0_EXT);
//! fbo.attachTexture(GL_TEXTURE_2D, texId1, GL_COLOR_ATTACHMENT1_EXT);
//! fbo.isValid();
//! \endcode
//!
//! The first usage pattern binds the FBO only once, whereas
//! the second usage binds/unbinds the FBO for each method call.
//!
//! 2) Use GLFramebufferObject::disable() sparingly. We have intentionally left
//! out an "unbind()" method because it is largely unnecessary and encourages
//! rendundant Bind/Unbind coding. Binding an FBO is usually much faster than
//! enabling/disabling a pbuffer, but is still a costly operation. When
//! switching between multiple FBOs and a visible OpenGL framebuffer, the
//! following usage pattern is recommended:
//!
//! \code{.cpp}
//! GLFramebufferObject fbo1, fbo2;
//! fbo1.bind();
//! ... Render ...
//! // NOTE : No Unbind/disable here...
//!
//! fbo2.bind();
//! ... Render ...
//!
//! // disable FBO rendering and return to visible window
//! // OpenGL framebuffer.
//! GLFramebufferObject::disable();
//! \endcode
//!

    //! semantic is performance. Providing "Unbind" would likely lead to a large
    //! number of unnecessary FBO enablings/disabling.
